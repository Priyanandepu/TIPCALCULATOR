# TIPCALCULATOR
A Tip Calculator calculates the split that is to be calculated among a given number of people plus the tip that is to be paid (tip=12% of the split)


for example, 
If the bill was $150.00, split between 5 people, with 12% tip. 

Each person should pay (150.00 / 5) * 1.12 = 33.6

Format the result to 2 decimal places = 33.60

Thus everyone's share of the total bill is $30.00 plus a $3.60 tip.
